# University
This is what i have done so far in the university
<br><br>
Some of them might be good, others I might not have cared enough, or lost the final version.
<br><br>
As far as i checked, they all work
<br><br>
Have fun coding
<br><br>
P.S For all those who are taking these courses, use it as a reference but do better than this. Reflecting back, these hws are easier than they appear!
